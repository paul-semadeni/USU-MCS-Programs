Program 3

For a 2-player normal form game:
a.	Identify all strongly dominated strategies (by either player)
b.	Identify any additional weakly dominated strategies ( by either player)
c.	Identify all pure strategy equilibria (if they exist)
d.	Identify Pareto optimal solutions.
e.	Identify a minimax strategy for each player.
f.	Identify a maximin strategy for each player.
g.	In repeated play, experiment with several strategies for each player.  Label the output with the strategies used.  How good were your strategies?



Input File format:
Number of actions for row player, number of actions for column player
Row player rewards (in row major order)
Column player rewards (in row major order)
    W	X	Y	Z

A	4, 3	4, 3	−1, −1	−1, −1
B	0, 0	3, 4	0, 0	3, 4
 Input would be:
2 4
4 4 -1 -1 0 3 0 3
3 3 -1 -1 0 4 0 4

Output
Test your program with input files prog2A.txt, prog2B.txt, prog2C.txt and an input file of your creation.
Compare your results with someone else in the class.
